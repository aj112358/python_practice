A spell checker can be a helpful tool for people who struggle to spell words correctly.
In this exercise, you will write a program that reads a file and displays all of thewords
in it that are misspelled. Misspelled words will be identified by checking each word
in the file against a list of known words. Any words in the user’s file that do not
appear in the list of known words will be reported as spelling mistakes.

The user will provide the name of the file to check for spelling mistakes as a
command line argument. Your program should display an appropriate error message
if the command line argument is missing. An error message should also be displayed
if your program is unable to open the user’s file.
